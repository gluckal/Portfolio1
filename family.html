            This is my immediate family. They are the best people in the world! 
            Starting from the left is me, my mom, my big sister Caroline, and my big sister Jessica. 
            Caroline is 23 years old and Jessica is 27 years old. Caroline went to Michigan and is the 
            reason I became interested in going to school here. My mom and two sisters are my built in 
            best friends.

        <p>
            These are my 4 first cousins on my dad's side, and my two big sisters. My cousins are the best,
            they are like my sisters! This past September my sisters and I were my cousins bridesmaid at her
            wedding. I feel so lucky to have such loving family members.

        <p>
            This is my Grandma Anita. Grandma Anita is my mom's mom. My Grandma is 83 years old. 
            My Grandma lives only 15 minutes away from me! When I am home I get to see my Grandma at least
            once a week. My grandma is the best cook and has the biggest heart. I can't wait to see her
            at Thanksgiving.
