                This is from this past May I took a trip to Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Lake Tahoe 
                is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. While in Lake Tahoe, 
                I got to kayak, swim, hike, and bike.

                Last January I took a weekend trip to Chicago with my friends. We took the train from Ann Arbor
                which was very convenient. While in Chicago I saw the bean, a broadway show, and ate deep dish
                pizza. Chicago is a great city and I hope to go back one day.

                During the Summer of 2018 I lived in Tel Aviv, Israel for six weeks. I participated in
                a program called the Israel Summer Business Academy. During the week we would attend class and 
                visit companies. On the weekend, we would travel around the country of Israel.

    <div class = lbi>
            <p>
                This trip was filled with relaxation as it was exactly a week before I headed back to 
                Ann Arbor for school. During the trip we laid on the beach, got massages, did yoga, 
                and ate yummy meals. I hope to do a beach trip like this one next summer!

                In May I traveled to Croatia through the Ross Global Imersion program. After the program ended, 
                I extended my travels and visited Dubrovnik. Dubrovnik is a beautiful city, and many episodes
                of Game of Thrones was filmed here. I loved the city of Dubrovnik.

                This is a picture of the cherry blossoms in Washington D.C. My older sister Caroline lived
                in Washington D.C. for 2 years. I loved visiting her during cherry blossom season. 
                These trees are majestical, and I enjoyed looking at them when I visited her.
