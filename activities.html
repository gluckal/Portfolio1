          <p>
              This is a picture of me running cross country. I ran cross country all four years of high school. I made the varsity team
              during my junior and senior year. The sport is still very special to me. I keep in touch with my coaches and all of my friends
              that I met while on the team. In my free time, I like to go for runs and I am reminded the time in my life
              where I was a competitive cross country athlete.

            <p>
              I took this photo this past summer while at Long Branch Beach with my mom in New Jersey. 
              We took this trip together in August a week before I went back to school. The purpose of the trip was to relax
              before I went back to college. Long Branch is my family's favorite beach in New Jersey.

                 I can't wait to see Luna when I go home for Thanksgiving break.

                   This summer I lived in New York City. This is a picture I took while having dinner
                   in Madison Square Park. I worked in Midtown this summer but lived in Union Square. Living
                   in Manhatten was a great experience. I am excited to live there again this summer!

                     I even attended the Notre Dame Game in the pouring rain a few weeks ago. I am very excited to 
                     watch our team play Michigan State and Ohio State. GO BLUE!

                       is a special place for the Gluck family. Growing up, my father went to camp on

                       got married this past September at the Sagamore, a hotel, on Lake George. This picture was 
                       from the day before her wedding.

                         I am serving as the "analyst" chair position. "PBL" has allowed me to become

                           Aunt Jake's. Aunt Jake's is an Italian restaurant. Between lunch and dinner, 
                           the restaurant closes down and conducts a cooking class several times a week.
                           The class was a birthday present and I had so much fun!
