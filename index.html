        <p>I am from a small suburban town in New Jersey called Woodcliff Lake. However, currently I live in Ann Arbor 
            as I attend the University of Michigan. I am currently a junior here in the School of 
            Information. This summer I will be working for PwC as a technology consultant in New York City. In my free
            time, I enjoy working out, hanging out with my friends, and watching documentaries.

                <h1>Croatia</h1>
                <p>Last May I went to Croatia through the Ross School of Business. 
                    I studied at Zagreb University for two weeks and lived in Zagreb. On the 
                    weekends we got to other cities in Croatia such as Split. I had a great trip!

                    <h1>Head Shot</h1>
                    <p> This head shot was taken by a member of my professional business fraternity, Phi Beta 
                        Lambda (PBL). I am very involved in PBL. This semester I served as the Analyst chair. In 
                        fact, you can find this headshot of me on the PBL website!
